abstract = {Summary. The sigmoid dosage-mortality curve, secured so commonly in toxicity tests upon multicellular organisms, is interpreted as a cumulative normal frequency distribution of the variation among the individuals of a population in their susceptibility to a toxic agent, which susceptibility is inversely proportional to the logarithm of the dose applied. In support of this interpretation is the fact that when dosage is inferred from the observed mortality on the assumption that susceptibility is distributed normally, such inferred dosages, in terms of units called probits, give straight lines when plotted against the logarithm of their corresponding observed dosages. It is shown that this use of the logarithm of the dosage can be interpreted in terms either of the Weber-Fechner law or of the amount of poison fixed by the tissues of the organism. How this transformation to a straight regression line facilitates the precise estimation of the dosage-mortality relationship and its accuracy is considered in detail. Statistical methods are described for taking account of tests which result in 0 or 100 per cent, kill, for giving each determination a weight proportional to its reliability, for computing the position and slope of the transformed dosage-mortality curve, for measuring the goodness of fit of the regression line to the observations by the X2 test, and for calculating the error in position and in slope and their combined effect at any log. dosage. The terminology and procedures are consistent with those used by R. A. Fisher, who has contributed an appendix on the case of zero survivors. Except for a table of common logarithms, all the tables required to utilise the methods described are given either in the present paper or in Fisher's book. A numerical example selected from Strand's experiments upon Tribolium confusum with carbon disulphide has been worked out in detail.},

 abstract = {We study general properties of the class of exponential dispersion models, which is the multivariate generalization of the error distribution of Nelder and Wedderburn's (1972) generalized linear models. Since any given moment generating function generates an exponential dispersion model, there exists a multitude of exponential dispersion models, and some new examples are introduced. General results on convolution and asymptotic normality of exponential dispersion models are presented. Asymptotic theory is discussed, including a new small-dispersion asymptotic framework, which extends the domain of application of large-sample theory. Procedures for constructing new exponential dispersion models for correlated data are introduced, including models for longitudinal data and variance components. The results of the paper unify and generalize standard results for distributions such as the Poisson, the binomial, the negative binomial, the normal, the gamma, and the inverse Gaussian distributions.},

 abstract = {Generalized linear models are used for regression analysis in a number of cases, including categorical responses, where the classical assumptions are violated. The statistical analysis of such models is based on the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator. We present mild general conditions which, respectively, assure weak or strong consistency or asymptotic normality. Most of the previous work has been concerned with natural link functions. In this case our normality condition, though obtained by a different approach, is closely related to a condition of Haberman (1977a). Examples show how the general conditions reduce to weak requirements for special exponential families. Further, for regressors with a compact range, sufficient conditions are given which do not involve the unknown parameter, and are therefore easy to check in practice. Responses with a bounded range, e.g. categorical responses, and stochastic regressors also are treated.},

Using this result, an extension of Cochran's theorem to quadratic forms of noncentral chi-square variables is derived.},

    abstract = "{Generalized linear models were defined by Nelder amp; Wedderburn (1972) and include a large class of useful statistical models. It is shown that for some of these models maximum likelihood estimates always exist and that for some others they exist provided certain degeneracies in the data do not occur. Similar results are obtained for uniqueness of maximum likelihood estimates and for their being confined to the interior of the parameter space. For instance, with the familiar model of probit analysis it is shown that under certain conditions the maximum likelihood estimate exists, and that if it does exist it is unique. The models considered also include those involving the normal, Poisson and gamma distributions with power and logarithmic transformations to linearity.}",
